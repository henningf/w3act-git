Dear Sir/Madam,

The British Library would like to archive your website in the UK Web Archive and to make it publicly available. The UK Web Archive was established in 2004 to capture and archive websites from the UK domain and across the web, responding to the challenge of a digital black hole in the nations memory. It contains specially selected websites that represent different aspects of UK heritage on the web, as well as important global events.  We work closely with leading international institutions to collect and permanently preserve the web, and the open UK Web Archive can be seen at http://www.webarchive.org.uk/.

If you are happy for your site to be archived and made publicly available, please complete the online licence form ||LINK|| that will permit us to proceed.  Archiving is free and does not normally require any effort on your part. If there are any other of your sites which you would like to be considered for archiving, you are most welcome to nominate them at www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/info/nominate.
Information about copyright and how your archived website will be made available can be found in our FAQs at www.webarchive.org.uk/ukwa/info/faq . Should you require any additional information, please do not hesitate to contact us.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards
